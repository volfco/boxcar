- [+] Once an RPC is finished, the message needs to be sent to all clients who are subscribed
  - [+] Track subscribers
    - [+] clients are automatically subscribed to all tasks they create - done via an async task that blocks on the task notify
    - [ ] clients are un-subscribe on connection close - async task that blocks on notify could also be used to loop over subscribers
  - [ ] Add method to subscribe to slot
  - [ ] Add method to un-subscribe to slot
- [ ] Support streaming of messages from task to client. Pass a queue to the handle method, which will forward messages
      - might make sense to re-factor the notification method so both are handled by one thing.
        RpcResult::Some(Vec<u8>) maybe? Only close the task once the shutdown notify has been triggered?
- [ ] Make sure that RPCs to an in-use session are rejected
- [ ] Add way to expose 'internal' data to RPC Method Handler


- garbage collect results after X unit of time.
  - time based?
  - # of RPCs executed?
